Installation instructions
=========================

Installation follows standard symfony2 application deployment: http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/deployment/tools.html

The short version:

* Put this code on the server.
* Run `php app/check.php` in the project root directory to make sure you meet requirements, fix as neccesary.
* Install dependencies:
  * Install composer: https://getcomposer.org/
  * Run `composer install` in the project root directory.
* Fix file permissions
  * `app/logs` and `app/cache` should be writable by the web server (apache)
* Make sure the web server serves ONLY the `web` directory of the project. Doing otherwise is a security risk.
* Setup the database
    * Create a database for the project (mysql is tested)
    * Enter connection details into `app/config/parameters.yml`, clear `app/cache` directory afterwards.
    * run `php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force --no-debug` in the project root to create all tables.
* You should now be able to visit the app backend and frontend in your web browser.
  * Backend is at `http://YOUR_HOST_NAME/admin` 
  * Username `admin`
  * Password is in `app/parameters.yml`, change as neccesary, clear `app/cache` directory afterwards.
* Run `php app/console app:wiki:download_translations` in the project root to download translations for all articles.
  * Setup a crontab to do this regularly, as the multilanguage and search function depend on it.
